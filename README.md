# ExpenseTracker
an expense tracker for students to track their daily expenses about different categories.
i tried to code a webpage that lets students add their daily expenses: which they can see in a tabular format along with a pie chart that visualises the relative spending among different categories
there is also a weekly trends page, however that is a work in progress.
the idea of that page is to represent the daily expenseses over a week in a bar graph format both cost-wise and category-wise.
