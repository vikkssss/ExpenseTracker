# ExpenseTracker
an expense tracker for students to track their daily expenses about different categories.

i tried to code a webpage that lets students 

-  click on a date to check the amount youve spent that day viusalised with a pie chart and a table
-  view, add and delete expenses for a particular date
  
there is also a weekly trends page, however that is a work in progress.
the idea of that page is to represent the daily expenseses over a week in a bar graph format both cost-wise and category-wise.

Thank you :)
