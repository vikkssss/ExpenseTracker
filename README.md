# ExpenseTracker
an expense tracker for students to track their daily expenses about different categories.

i tried to code a webpage that lets students 

-  click on a date to check the amount youve spent that day viusalised with a pie chart and a table
-  view, add and delete expenses for a particular date

(UPDATED WEEKLY TRENDS PAGE!)
the weekly trends page displays the most recent week's analysis using a stacked bar graph for representing relative spending from categories.
